## Motors and Sensor Setup
	
- Make sure the cables are plugged in according to the diagram below

<details>
		<summary>Wiring diagram</summary>
		<img src="wiring-diagram.png" alt="wiring diagram"></img>
</details>

- In robotc, at the top click on `Robot` > `Motors and Sensors Setup`
- Go through the `Motors`, `Analog`, and `Digital` tabs and name and assign ports appropriately. Select `Ok` to close window
- Before writing any code, click `Save As` and name the file '\<last name> template'
- Save on your desktop and upload to google drive

## Basic Programming

### Problem 1

- The left motor starts at half speed CW for 1 second then turns off
- The right motor starts at half speed CW for 1 second then turns off
- The LED turns on for 2 seconds then turns off

___

### Problem 2

- The left motor starts at half speed CW until __the bump switch is pressed__ then turns off
- The right motor starts at half speed CW until __the limit switch is pressed__ then turns off
- The LED turns on until the __bump switch is pressed__ then turns off

___

### Problem 3

>__Notice__: Make sure the potentiometer is at zero before running this program

- The left motor starts at half speed CW until __the potentiometer is turned to 1500__ then turns off
- The right motor starts at half speed CW until __the light sensor is covered__ then turns off
- The LED turns on until __something comes within 6 inches of the sonar__ then turns off

___

### Problem 4

- The __right__ motor starts at half speed CW until __the bump switch is pressed__ then turns off
- Wait 1 Second
- The servo motor turns 60 degrees to the right _(set it to 127)_
- Wait until __the limit switch is pressed__
- Move the servo back to home position _(set it to 0)_
- Wait 1 second
- The __left__ motor starts at half speed CW until __the quad encoder turns 1 full rotation__ then turns off

## While Loops and Timers

### Problem 5

- Forever:
	- The left motor starts at half speed CW for 1 second then turns off
	- The right motor starts at half speed CW for 1 second then turns off
	- The LED turns on for 2 seconds then turns off

___

### Problem 6

Copy program 5, but run for __10 seconds__ rather than forever

___

### Problem 7

- Forever:
	- Wait until the __light sensor__ is __blocked__ then turn __on__ the flashlight
	- Wait until the __light sensor__ is __not blocked__ then turn __off__ the flashlight

___

### Problem 8

Same as problem 7, but flashlight is only affected while the limit switch is __not__ pressed
>Make sure it still loops forever

___

### Problem 9

- Wait until the __bump switch__ is pressed
- LED turns on
- Wait 1 second
- For 15 seconds:
	- The __left motor__ starts at half speed CW until __the bump switch is pressed__ then turns off
	- The __right motor__ starts at half speed CW until __the limit switch is pressed__ then turns off
- The LED turns __off__ for 1 second
- The LED turns back __on__ for 1 second and then turns off

## If-Else Statements

### Problem 10

- If the __line follower__ is __covered__, the LED turns __on__
- If the __line follower__ is __not covered,__ the LED turns __off__

### Problem 11

- If the bump switch is pressed, the right motor turns CW at half speed
- If the limit switch is pressed, the left motor turns CW at half speed

>If the switches are not pressed, be sure to stop the motors

### Problem 12

- Forever:
	- If the light sensor is covered, the flashlight turns on
	- If the light sensor is not covered, the flashlight turns off

>Looks similar to 7, but this one uses if statements

### Problem 13

- Forever:
	- If the limit switch is pressed, the servo motor turns either left or right _(127 or -127)_ depending on if the light sensor is covered
	- If the limit switch is not pressed, the servo motor moves to the home position

### Problem 14

- If the bump switch is pressed, the left motor turns CW at half speed
- If the limit switch is pressed, the right motor turns CW at half speed
- If the line follower is covered, the flashlight turns on

>Be sure that if each respective sensor is not covered/pressed, the motor or flashlight associated with it turns off

## Variables and Functions

### Problem 15

Same as problem 1, but do it 5 times. Use `loopcount` as a variable name

### Problem 16

Same as problem 1, but use a function named `motorloop` and loop forever

### Problem 17

Same as problem 1, but use a function named `motorloop` and a variable named `loopcount` and loop 5 times

## Putting it all Together

### Problem 18

- Wait until the limit switch is pressed
- LED turns on
- Loop 5 times:
	- If light sensor is covered:
		- Left motor turns CW at half speed for 1 second then stops
		- Servo motor turns to 60 degrees to the right, stays for 2 seconds, then moves back to home position
	- If light sensor is not covered:
		- Right motor turns CW at half speed for 2 seconds then stops
		- Servo motor turns to 60 degrees to the left, stays for 2 seconds, then moves back to home position
